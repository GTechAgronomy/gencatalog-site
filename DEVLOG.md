## Rules / Conventions

### R2 release artifacts must live at the bucket root
The public hostname `downloads.gencatalog.app` serves from the **root** of the `gencatalog-downloads` R2 bucket — **not** from `updates/`.

When a release is uploaded to `gencatalog-downloads/updates/...`, the site's download buttons (which point at `downloads.gencatalog.app/GenCatalog-X.Y.Z-universal.dmg`) return `File not found` to end users.

**On every release, copy these files from `updates/` to the bucket root:**
- `GenCatalog-<version>-universal.dmg` + `.blockmap`
- `GenCatalog-<version>-universal-mac.zip` + `.blockmap`
- `GenCatalog-<version>-Setup.exe` + `.blockmap`
- `GenCatalog-Extension-v<version>.zip` (if a new extension ships)
- `latest.yml` (overwrites prior — flips electron-updater on Windows)
- `latest-mac.yml` (overwrites prior — flips electron-updater on Mac)

Fast way (rclone with the `r2` remote configured):
```
for f in <files>; do rclone copyto "r2:gencatalog-downloads/updates/$f" "r2:gencatalog-downloads/$f"; done
```

Verify each URL returns `200` via `curl -I https://downloads.gencatalog.app/<file>` before announcing the release. Leave the `updates/` copies in place as an archive.
